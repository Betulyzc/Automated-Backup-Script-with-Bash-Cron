## Versions:

ðŸ”¹ Static Version
- Works only from a specific directory (e.g., /home/user/static_Backup_Cleanup_Version)
- Hardcoded backup & log paths
- Suitable for consistent and fixed environments
- Has a basic cleanup script
- **Static Version**:Backs up all files every time, regardless of changes.

ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Version
- Can be placed and run from any directory
- Automatically excludes itself, logs, and backups
- Tracks file changes using timestamps
- Skips redundant backups and logs the skip events
- Advanced cleanup with multiple log types
- Easily integrable with crontab
- **Dynamic Version**:Backs up only modified or new files since the last backup.

## Technologies Used:
- Bash Scripting
- Cron Jobs
- tar + gzip
- find, touch, date

Getting Started:

To run a version:
chmod +x backup.sh cleanUp.sh
./backup.sh
./cleanUp.sh

To automate:
crontab -e

Example cron entry (every day at midnight):
0 0 * * * /path/to/your/dynamic_Backup_Cleanup_Version/backup.sh >> /path/to/cron_debug.log 2>&1


Notes:
- skipLogs/ are only created when no backup is performed.
- Cleanup scripts remove old backups and logs (default: 7 days).
- Errors from cron jobs are logged in cron_debug.log.
