# Backup and Cleanup Script  

This project provides a modular, Bash-based backup automation system with optional cleanup and cron job integration. 
It includes static and dynamic backup options, offering flexibility for different usage needs.
Detailed Readme files for each version are included in the folders.

## Versions:

ðŸ”¹ Static Version
- Works only from a specific directory (e.g., /home/user/static_Backup_Cleanup_Version)
- Hardcoded backup & log paths
- Suitable for consistent and fixed environments
- Has a basic cleanup script
- **Static Version**:Backs up all files every time, regardless of changes.

ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Version
- Can be placed and run from any directory
- Automatically excludes itself, logs, and backups
- Tracks file changes using timestamps
- Skips redundant backups and logs the skip events
- Advanced cleanup with multiple log types
- Easily integrable with crontab
- **Dynamic Version**:Backs up only modified or new files since the last backup.

## Technologies Used:
- Bash Scripting
- Cron Jobs
- tar + gzip
- find, touch, date

## Getting Started:

- To run a version:
chmod +x backup.sh cleanUp.sh
./backup.sh
./cleanUp.sh

- To automate:
crontab -e

- Example cron entry (every day at midnight):
0 0 * * * /path/to/your/dynamic_Backup_Cleanup_Version/backup.sh >> /path/to/cron_debug.log 2>&1


## Notes:

- skipLogs/ are only created when no backup is performed.
- Cleanup scripts remove old backups and logs (default: 7 days).
- Errors from cron jobs are logged in cron_debug.log.
